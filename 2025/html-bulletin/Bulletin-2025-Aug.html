The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker�s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component that could affect component-wide settings and files."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>On April 18th 2025, Microsoft announced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/exchange-server-security-changes-for-hybrid-deployments/4396833">Exchange Server Security Changes for Hybrid Deployments</a> and accompanying non-security <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/released-april-2025-exchange-server-hotfix-updates/4402471">Hot Fix</a>. Microsoft made these changes in the general interest of improving the security of hybrid Exchange deployments. Following further investigation, Microsoft identified specific security implications tied to the guidance and configuration steps outlined in the April announcement. Microsoft is issuing CVE-2025-53786 to document a vulnerability that is addressed by taking the steps documented with the April 18th announcement. Microsoft strongly recommends reading the information, installing the April 2025 (or later) Hot Fix and implementing the changes in your Exchange Server and hybrid environment.</p>

        <br>
        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>What privileges could be gained by an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability within the organization’s cloud environment?</strong></p>
<p>In an Exchange hybrid deployment, an attacker who first gains administrative access to an on-premises Exchange server could potentially escalate privileges within the organization’s connected cloud environment without leaving easily detectable and auditable trace. This risk arises because Exchange Server and Exchange Online share the same service principal in hybrid configurations.</p>
<br><p><strong>According to the CVSS metric, successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>In this scenario, successfully exploiting the vulnerability could enable an attacker to escalate privileges within the organization’s connected cloud environment without leaving easily detectable and auditable traces.</p>
<br><p><strong>According to the CVSS metric, the attack complexity is high (AC:H). What does that mean for this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to first gain or possess administrator access on an Exchange Server.</p>
<br><p><strong>Microsoft Exchange Server Subscription Edition RTM didn't exist in April when the hot fix was released.  Why is it listed in the Security Updates Table?</strong></p>
<p>Support for the dedicated Exchange hybrid app feature is already part of the initial release of the Exchange Server SE version. If you have already migrated to the newest version you already have this level of protection from the vulnerability. All you need to do is to follow the steps as outlined in the documentation to enable the feature and clear the certificates from the shared service principals keyCredentials.</p>
<br><p><strong>What steps do I need to take to better protect my hybrid environment?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you're using Exchange hybrid, install the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/released-april-2025-exchange-server-hotfix-updates/4402471">Hot Fix</a> (or newer release) on your on-premises Exchange servers and follow the configuration instructions outlined in <a href="https://aka.ms/ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication-Docs">Deploy dedicated Exchange hybrid app</a>. For additional details, refer to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/exchange-server-security-changes-for-hybrid-deployments/4396833">Exchange Server Security Changes for Hybrid Deployments</a>. After completing the steps, be sure to <a href="https://aka.ms/ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication-Docs#service-principal-clean-up-mode">reset the service principal's keyCredentials</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’ve previously configured Exchange hybrid or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/configure-oauth-authentication-between-exchange-and-exchange-online-organizations-exchange-2013-help">OAuth authentication between Exchange Server and your Exchange Online organization</a> but no longer use it, make sure to <a href="https://aka.ms/ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication-Docs#service-principal-clean-up-mode">reset the service principal's keyCredentials</a>.</p>
