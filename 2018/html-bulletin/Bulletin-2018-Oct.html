Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist.

Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component.

Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability.

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An Elevation of Privilege vulnerability exists in Windows Subsystem for Linux when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to a target system and then run a specially crafted application.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Subsystem for Linux handles objects in memory.</p>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Significant details are published, but researchers either do not have full confidence in the root cause, or do not have access to source code to fully confirm all of the interactions that may lead to the result. Reasonable confidence exists, however, that the bug is reproducible and at least one impact is able to be verified (Proof-of-concept exploits may provide this). An example is a detailed write-up of research into a vulnerability with an explanation (possibly obfuscated or 'left as an exercise to the reader') that gives assurances on how to reproduce the results."><b>Reasonable</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An Elevation of Privilege vulnerability exists in Filter Manager when it improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute elevated code and take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to a target system and then delete a specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Filter Manager handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when &quot;Windows Theme API&quot; does not properly decompress files.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a victim user must open a specially crafted file. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force a user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that &quot;Windows Theme API&quot; properly decompresses files.</p>

                            <tr><td title="This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.</p>
<p>The attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.</p>
<p>The attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.</p>
<p>The attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Yammer desktop application due to the loading of arbitrary content. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to convince the victim to click the special URL in the desktop application that redirect to the attacker-controlled web-page. After the content from attacker-controlled web-page is loaded by the desktop application, the attacker can gain control of the victim’s machine.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by disallowing loading of arbitrary content in the desktop application.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft JET Database Engine.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open/import a specially crafted Microsoft JET Database Engine file. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user, and then convince the user to open the file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Microsoft JET Database Engine handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

                            <tr><td title="This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or instant message, or by getting the user to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Exchange software parses specially crafted email messages.  An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the system user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, add, or delete data.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted email to an affected Exchange server, and then convince the recipient to perform multiple actions while replying to the message.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Exchange parses specially crafted email messages.</p>

This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI)  handles objects in memory, allowing an attacker to retrieve information from a targeted system. By itself, the information disclosure does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI handles memory addresses.</p>

        <br>
        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>What type of information could be disclosed by this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>The type of information that could be disclosed if an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability is memory layout - the vulnerability allows an attacker to collect information that facilitates predicting addressing of the memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited at the protocol level to a logically adjacent topology. This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone)"><b>Adjacent</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component that could affect component-wide settings and files."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability.

For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component.

It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could run a specially crafted application on a guest operating system that could cause the Hyper-V host operating system to execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Hyper-V validates guest operating system user input.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited at the protocol level to a logically adjacent topology. This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone)"><b>Adjacent</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component that could affect component-wide settings and files."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could run a specially crafted application on a guest operating system that could cause the Hyper-V host operating system to execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Hyper-V validates guest operating system user input.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or instant message, or by getting the user to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.</p>

Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Device Guard that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a Windows PowerShell session. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject code into a trusted PowerShell process to bypass the Device Guard Code Integrity policy on the local machine.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to access the local machine, and then inject malicious code into a script that is trusted by the Code Integrity policy. The injected code would then run with the same trust level as the script and bypass the Code Integrity policy.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how PowerShell exposes functions and processes user supplied code.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Microsoft XML Core Services MSXML parser processes user input. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run malicious code remotely to take control of the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to invoke MSXML through a web browser. However, an attacker would have no way to force a user to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would typically have to convince a user to either click a link in an email message or instant message that would then take the user to the website. When Internet Explorer parses the XML content, an attacker could run malicious code remotely to take control of the user’s system.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the MSXML parser processes user input.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Shell improperly handles URIs. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attack requires specific user interaction which an attacker would need to trick the user into performing. There is no way an attacker could exploit the vulnerability without the user performing the specific action.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Windows Shell handles URIs.</p>

The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.</p>
<p>The attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the ChakraCore scripting engine handles objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user.</p>
<p>If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the ChakraCore scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

     <td>        <b>CVE Title:</b> Microsoft PowerPoint Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
        <br>
        <b>CVSS:</b> <br>None
        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft PowerPoint software when the software fails to properly handle objects in Protected View. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office PowerPoint software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>Note that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for this vulnerability. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft PowerPoint handles objects in Protected View.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel software when the software fails to properly handle objects in Protected View. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office Excel software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>Note that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for this vulnerability. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Excel handles objects in Protected View.</p>

                            <tr><td title="This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>CVSS:</b> <br>None
        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word software when the software fails to properly handle objects in Protected View. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office Word software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>Note that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for this vulnerability. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Word handles objects in Protected View.</p>

                            <tr><td title="This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly handles requests of different origins. The vulnerability allows Microsoft Edge to bypass Same-Origin Policy (SOP) restrictions, and to allow requests that should otherwise be ignored. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could force the browser to send data that would otherwise be restricted.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how affected Microsoft Edge handles different-origin requests.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions.

That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component?

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that certain applications built using Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) handle the loading of DLL files.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how applications built using MFC load DLL files.</p>

        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>Why is Microsoft documenting a 2010 CVE in this release?</strong></p>
<p>Exchange Server was not identified as an in-scope product when CVE-2010-3190 was originally published. This vulnerability affects all installations of Exchange Server. If you are running any version of Exchange server released prior to Exchange Server 2016 Cumulative Update 11 (as of this publishing, Cumulative Update 10 is the most recent cumulative update for Exchange 2016), the Visual Studio 2010 updates in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2011/ms11-025">MS11-025</a> should be applied to your Exchange Server.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else that I need to do to ensure that my Exchange server remains protected from this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you must install the next cumulative update for your Exchange server when it becomes available. This <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh135098%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">document</a> will be revised at such time to include information on where to obtain the update.</p>

        <b>CVSS:</b> <br>None
        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) when parsing a malicious XEL file containing a reference to an external entity. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read arbitrary files via an XML external entity declaration.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must entice a user on an affected SSMS server to open a specially crafted XEL file. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force a user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to click a link and open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how SQL Server Management Studio parses XML input.</p>

        <br>
        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>1. What type of information could be disclosed by this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>The type of information that could be disclosed if an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability is unauthorized file system access - reading from file system.</p>
<p><strong>2. How can I ensure my computer is protected from this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>For all versions of SQL Server Management Studio installed on this computer, you can protect your system from this vulnerability by disabling DTD processing of XML query results. Please follow the steps described in the <strong>Workaround</strong> section.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Mitigations:</b><br>None
        <br>
        <b>Workarounds:</b><br><p>Users who are unable to clean-install SSMS 17.9 can protect themselves from this vulnerability by disabling DTD processing of XML query results by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Options</strong>, select <strong>Text Editor</strong>, select  <strong>XML</strong>, and then select <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Network</strong>, clear the <strong>Automatically download DTDs and schemas</strong> check box.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround</strong></p>
<p>SSMS will not automatically process XML, XEL, or XMLA files.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly handles requests of different origins. The vulnerability allows Microsoft Edge to bypass Same-Origin Policy (SOP) restrictions, and to allow requests that should otherwise be ignored. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could force the browser to send data that would otherwise be restricted.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how affected Microsoft Edge handles different-origin requests.</p>

        <br>
        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>After I installed the security update and restarted my device, third-party cookies are no longer blocked even though I had previously selected that setting. What do I do?</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, after installing the security updates, sites you visit might still be able to use third-party cookies that they originally set on your browser before Microsoft updated the setting. To learn more and to reset your browser cookies, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464209">Microsoft Knowledge Base article 4464209</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance for Enterprise Admins:</strong></p>
<p>Enterprise admins can optionally choose to show a warning dialog to users in their environments that informs them about this issue. This dialog will be displayed on the first launch of Microsoft Edge after the Windows 10 October Update has been installed on the users' machines, and will only be shown to users who had previously set the <strong>Block only third party cookies</strong> setting in Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>To show this warning dialog, Enterprise admins need to configure and deploy the following reg key:</p>
<p><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppContainer\Storage\microsoft.microsoftedge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\MicrosoftEdge\Main\ ThirdPartyCookiesMessageManagedOptIn</code></p>
<p>The value DWORD (32-bit) registry key should be set to 1.</p>
<p>Note that users in enterprises will not get any in-product notifications about this issue unless their admin configures and deploys this ThirdPartyCookiesMessageManagedOptIn registry value. This reg key will only display the notification on devices running Desktop and Mobile versions of Windows 10.</p>

        <b>CVSS:</b> <br>None
        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Azure IoT Hub Device Client SDK using MQTT protocol accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically via an enticement in email or instant message, or by getting them to open an email attachment.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by changing the default allocators.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) when parsing a malicious XMLA file containing a reference to an external entity. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read arbitrary files via an XML external entity declaration.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must entice a user on an affected SSMS server to open a specially crafted XMLA file. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force a user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to click a link and open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how SQL Server Management Studio parses XML input.</p>

        <br>
        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>1. What type of information could be disclosed by this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>The type of information that could be disclosed if an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability is unauthorized file system access - reading from file system.</p>
<p><strong>2. How can I ensure my computer is protected from this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>For all versions of SQL Server Management Studio installed on this computer, you can protect your system from this vulnerability by disabling DTD processing of XML query results. Please follow the steps described in the <strong>Workaround</strong> section.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Mitigations:</b><br>None
        <br>
        <b>Workarounds:</b><br><p>Users who are unable to clean-install SSMS 17.9 can protect themselves from this vulnerability by disabling DTD processing of XML query results by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Options</strong>, select <strong>Text Editor</strong>, select  <strong>XML</strong>, and then select <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Network</strong>, clear the <strong>Automatically download DTDs and schemas</strong> check box.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround</strong></p>
<p>SSMS will not automatically process XML, XEL, or XMLA files.</p>
