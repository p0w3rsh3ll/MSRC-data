Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge based on Edge HTML improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge based on Edge HTML handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.</p>
<p>The attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. For example, the file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.</p>

Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in memory, allowing an attacker to retrieve information from a targeted system. By itself, the information disclosure does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.</p>
<p>Note that where the severity is indicated as Critical in the Affected Products table, the Preview Pane is an attack vector for this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI handles memory addresses.</p>

        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?</strong></p>
<p>When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.</p>
<p>For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.</p>
<p>For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335</a>. For a list of Microsoft Office products that an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A  information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows GDI+ component improperly discloses kernel memory addresses. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows GDI+ component handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.</p>

Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A  information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows GDI+ component improperly discloses kernel memory addresses. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows GDI+ component handles objects in memory.</p>

Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A  information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows GDI+ component improperly discloses kernel memory addresses. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows GDI+ component handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts.</p>

        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?</strong></p>
<p>When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.</p>
<p>For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A  information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows GDI+ component improperly discloses kernel memory addresses. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows GDI+ component handles objects in memory.</p>

Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A  information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows GDI+ component improperly discloses kernel memory addresses. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows GDI+ component handles objects in memory.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI)  handles objects in memory, allowing an attacker to retrieve information from a targeted system. By itself, the information disclosure does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI handles memory addresses.</p>

This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone)"><b>Adjacent</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain.

        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>How could an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities?</strong>
In a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer for the desktop, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit any of these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer in the Windows 8-style UI, an attacker would first need to compromise a website already listed in the Compatibility View (CV) list. An attacker could then host a website that contains specially crafted Flash content designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

<p><strong>Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running</strong>
You can disable attempts to instantiate Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer and other applications that honor the kill bit feature, such as Office 2007 and Office 2010, by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To set the kill bit for the control in the registry, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Paste the following into a text file and save it with the .reg file extension.</p>
<pre><code> Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
 &quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400

 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
 &quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.</p>
<p>You can also apply this workaround across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, Group Policy collection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
<strong>Impact of workaround</strong>. There is no impact as long as the object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.
<strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong> Delete the registry keys that were added in implementing this workaround.
<strong>Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Internet Explorer through Group Policy</strong>
<strong>Note</strong> The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit, or for an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831791">Group Policy Overview</a>
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc737816%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">What is Group Policy Object Editor?</a>
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc784165%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">Core Group Policy tools and settings</a></p>
<p>To disable Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer through Group Policy, perform the following steps:
<strong>Note</strong> This workaround does not prevent Flash from being invoked from other applications, such as Microsoft Office 2007 or Microsoft Office 2010.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Group Policy Management Console and configure the console to work with the appropriate Group Policy object, such as local machine, OU, or domain GPO.</li>
<li>Navigate to the following node:
<strong>Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Internet Explorer -&gt; Security Features -&gt; Add-on Management</strong></li>
<li>Double-click <strong>Turn off Adobe Flash in Internet Explorer and prevent applications from using Internet Explorer technology to instantiate Flash objects</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the setting to Enabled.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong> to return to the Group Policy Management Console.</li>
<li>Refresh Group Policy on all systems or wait for the next scheduled Group Policy refresh interval for the settings to take effect.
<strong>Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Office 2010 on affected systems</strong>
<strong>Note</strong> This workaround does not prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Internet Explorer.
<strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow the steps in the article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>To disable Adobe Flash Player in Office 2010 only, set the kill bit for the ActiveX control for Adobe Flash Player in the registry using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a text file named Disable_Flash.reg with the following contents:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>		[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM\Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
	&quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong> You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
You can also apply this workaround across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=215719">Group Policy collection</a>.
<strong>Prevent ActiveX controls from running in Office 2007 and Office 2010</strong></li>

<ol>
<li>Click File, click Options, click Trust Center, and then click Trust Center Settings.</li>
<li>Click ActiveX Settings in the left-hand pane, and then select Disable all controls without notifications.</li>
<li>Click OK to save your settings.
<strong>Impact of workaround</strong>. Office documents that use embedded ActiveX controls may not display as intended.
<strong>How to undo the workaround</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To re-enable ActiveX controls in Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click File, click Options, click Trust Center, and then click Trust Center Settings.</li>
<li>Click ActiveX Settings in the left-hand pane, and then deselect Disable all controls without notifications.</li>
<li>Click OK to save your settings.
<strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to &quot;High&quot; to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong>
You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.</li>
</ol>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click** Internet Option**s.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Internet</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
<strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
<strong>Impact of workaround</strong>. There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites on the Internet or an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone&quot;.
<strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to return to Internet Explorer, and then click <strong>OK</strong> again.
<strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
<strong>Impact of workaround</strong>. There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone&quot;.
<strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone</strong>
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this website to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
<strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two sites in particular that you may want to add are *<strong>.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</strong> and *<strong>.update.microsoft.com</strong>. These are the sites that will host the update, and they require an ActiveX control to install the update.</li>

        <b>CVSS:</b> <br>None
        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. For example, the file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.</p>
<p>The attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows PDF Library improperly handles objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability on Windows 10 systems with Microsoft Edge set as the default browser, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains malicious PDF content and then convince users to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted PDF content to such sites. Only Windows 10 systems with Microsoft Edge set as the default browser can be compromised simply by viewing a website. The browsers for all other affected operating systems do not automatically render PDF content, so an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to open a specially crafted PDF document, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message or by way of an email attachment.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how affected systems handle objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft browser JavaScript engines render content when handling objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the related rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browser JavaScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft Exchange Outlook Web Access (OWA) fails to properly handle web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform script/content injection attacks and attempt to trick the user into disclosing sensitive information.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email message containing a malicious link to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Exchange validates web requests.</p>
<p>Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A race condition that could lead to a remote code execution vulnerability exists in NetBT Session Services when NetBT fails to maintain certain sequencing requirements. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted NetBT Session Service packets to an impacted system.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how NetBT sequences certain operations.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>Note that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited at the protocol level to a logically adjacent topology. This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone)"><b>Adjacent</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A spoofing vulnerability exists in Microsoft's implementation of the Bluetooth stack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform a <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/dn848375.aspx#MiTM">man-in-the-middle attack</a> and force a user's computer to unknowingly route traffic through the attacker's computer. The attacker can then monitor and read the traffic before sending it on to the intended recipient.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker needs to be within the physical proximity of the targeted user, and the user's computer needs to have Bluetooth enabled. The attacker can then initiate a Bluetooth connection to the target computer without the user's knowledge.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles Bluetooth requests.</p>

<br>2.0&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp26/09/2017&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p>Information updated to correct package KB numbers for the Security Updates for affected editions of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Microsoft released security updates to address CVE-2017-8628 on July 11, 2017, and because it is one of a group of vulnerabilities collectively known as “BlueBorne” affecting software from multiple vendors, Microsoft published the CVE on September 12, 2017 as part of an industry-wide coordinated disclosure to remediate the vulnerability. Customers running Microsoft Windows need only to install the Windows updates that are offered to be protected from this vulnerability. Customers running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 who have not installed the September Monthly Rollup should install either the July Security Update or the September Monthly Rollup to be protected from this vulnerability. Customers running other affected versions of Windows who have already successfully installed the September Security Updates do not need to take any further action.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge based on Edge HTML improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge based on Edge HTML handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft browser JavaScript engines render content when handling objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the related rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browser JavaScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft browser JavaScript engines render content when handling objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the related rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browser JavaScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.</p>

In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists due to the way Windows Uniscribe handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to open the document file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Uniscribe handles objects in memory.</p>

                            <tr><td title="This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?</strong></p>
<p>When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.</p>
<p>For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.</p>
<p>For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335</a>. For a list of Microsoft Office products that an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists due to the way Windows Uniscribe handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to open the document file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Uniscribe handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Shell does not properly validate file copy destinations.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force a user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that Windows Shell validates file copy destinations.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component that could affect component-wide settings and files."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology.

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component that could affect component-wide settings and files."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Windows Hyper-V on a host operating system fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker on a guest operating system could run a specially crafted application that could cause the Hyper-V host operating system to disclose memory information.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain access to information on the Hyper-V host operating system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Hyper-V validates guest operating system user input.</p>

That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component that could affect component-wide settings and files."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component.

Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection.

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the VM Host Agent Service of Remote Desktop Virtual Host role when it fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could issue a specially crafted certificate on the guest operating system that could cause the VM host agent service on the host operating system to execute arbitrary code. The Remote Desktop Virtual Host role is not enabled by default.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how VM host agent service validates guest operating system user input.</p>

That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr>

The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain.

Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Microsoft Edge when the Edge <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/dn848375.aspx#CSP">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> fails to properly validate certain specially crafted documents. An attacker who exploited the bypass could trick a user into loading a page containing malicious content.</p>
<p>To exploit the bypass, an attacker must trick a user into either loading a page containing malicious content or visiting a malicious website. The attacker could also inject the malicious page into either a compromised website or an advertisement network.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the bypass by correcting how the Edge CSP validates documents.</p>

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could trick a user by redirecting the user to a specially crafted website. The specially crafted website could either spoof content or serve as a pivot to chain an attack with other vulnerabilities in web services.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, the user must click a specially crafted URL. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could send an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user in an attempt to convince the user to click it.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to appear as a legitimate website to the user. However, the attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the specially crafted website. The attacker would have to convince the user to visit the specially crafted website, typically by way of enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince the user to interact with content on the website.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Edge parses HTTP responses.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows PDF Library improperly handles objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability on Windows 10 systems with Microsoft Edge set as the default browser, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains malicious PDF content and then convince users to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted PDF content to such sites. Only Windows 10 systems with Microsoft Edge set as the default browser can be compromised simply by viewing a website. The browsers for all other affected operating systems do not automatically render PDF content, so an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to open a specially crafted PDF document, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message or by way of an email attachment.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how affected systems handle objects in memory.</p>

That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component.

Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Microsoft browsers due to improper parent domain verification in certain functionality. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain specific information that is used in the parent domain.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have access to host malicious content on a website this is on a subdomain of the parent domain, and then convince a user to visit the site.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that Microsoft browsers restrict access to certain functionality between the subdomain and the parent domain.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>CVSS:</b> <br>None
        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft PowerPoint software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office PowerPoint software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>Note that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for this vulnerability. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft PowerPoint handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft PowerPoint software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office PowerPoint software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>Note that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for this vulnerability. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft PowerPoint handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge does not properly parse HTTP content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could trick a user by redirecting the user to a specially crafted website. The specially crafted website could either spoof content or serve as a pivot to chain an attack with other vulnerabilities in web services.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, the user must click a specially crafted URL. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could send an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user in an attempt to convince the user to click it.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to appear as a legitimate website to the user. However, the attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the specially crafted website. The attacker would have to convince the user to visit the specially crafted website, typically by way of enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince the user to interact with content on the website.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Edge parses HTTP responses.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Device Guard that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a Windows PowerShell session. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject code into a trusted PowerShell process to bypass the Device Guard Code Integrity policy on the local machine.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to access the local machine, and then inject malicious code into a script that is trusted by the Code Integrity policy. The injected code would then run with the same trust level as the script and bypass the Code Integrity policy.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how PowerShell exposes functions and processes user supplied code.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or instant message, or by getting the user to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or instant message, or by getting the user to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft browsers access objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically via an enticement in email or instant message, or by getting them to open an email attachment.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browsers handle objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Microsoft Edge when the Edge <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/dn848375.aspx#CSP">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> fails to properly validate certain specially crafted documents. An attacker who exploited the bypass could trick a user into loading a page containing malicious content.</p>
<p>To exploit the bypass, an attacker must trick a user into either loading a page containing malicious content or visiting a malicious website. The attacker could also inject the malicious page into either a compromised website or an advertisement network.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the bypass by correcting how the Edge CSP validates documents.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.

Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions.

That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component.

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An input sanitization issue exists with Microsoft Exchange that could potentially result in unintended Information Disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could identify the existence of RFC1918 addresses on the local network from a client on the Internet. An attacker could use this internal host information as part of a larger attack.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could include specially crafted tags in Calendar-related messages sent to an Exchange server. These specially-tagged messages could prompt the Exchange server to fetch information from internal servers. By observing telemetry from these requests, a client could discern properties of internal hosts intended to be hidden from the Internet.</p>
<p>The update corrects the way that Exchange parses Calendar-related messages.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework processes untrusted input. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability in software using the .NET framework could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to convince the user to open a malicious document or application.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET validates untrusted input.</p>

        <br>
        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>How do I determine which version of Microsoft .NET Framework is installed on my system?</strong>
You can install and run multiple versions of .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. For more information, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I locate the updates for the versions of .NET Framework installed on my system?</strong>
The download links in the Affected Products table are to the Parent KB number in the Microsoft Update Catalog. To locate the packages you need to download, in the Microsoft Update Catalog, click <strong>Download</strong> for the platform you have installed on your system. In the <strong>Download</strong> window, click to download each update that is applicable to your system.</p>
<p>Customers who have updates automatically installed will be offered the Parent KB; however, the package KB numbers listed for each platform will be displayed in Add Remove Programs.</p>
<p>The following table lists the Parent KB numbers for the Monthly Rollup Releases and the Security Only Releases, and the package KB numbers they contain. For more information about Microsoft's update servicing model for Microsoft .NET Framework, see this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=829975">Microsoft .NET Blog Post</a>.</p>
