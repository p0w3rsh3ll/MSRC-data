        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. For example, the file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.</p>

These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>

        <b>CVSS:</b> <br>None
        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. For example, the file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Microsoft Outlook fails to properly validate authentication requests.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability an attacker would have to trick a user into browsing to a malicious website or to an SMB or UNC path destination. Alternatively the attacker could convince a user to load a malicious document that initiates an NTLM validation request without the consent of the user. An attacker who successfully tricked a user into disclosing the user's NTLM hash could attempt a brute-force attack to disclose the corresponding hash password.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Outlook validates authentication requests.</p>

        <br>
        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>In addition to addressing the vulnerability described in this CVE, do the security updates for Microsoft Outlook address any other issues?</strong>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects in memory.</p>

For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Exploit code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via an autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Exploit code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via an autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Significant details are published, but researchers either do not have full confidence in the root cause, or do not have access to source code to fully confirm all of the interactions that may lead to the result. Reasonable confidence exists, however, that the bug is reproducible and at least one impact is able to be verified (Proof-of-concept exploits may provide this). An example is a detailed write-up of research into a vulnerability with an explanation (possibly obfuscated or 'left as an exercise to the reader') that gives assurances on how to reproduce the results."><b>Reasonable</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology.

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited at the protocol level to a logically adjacent topology. This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone)"><b>Adjacent</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An Denial Of Service vulnerability exists when Windows Explorer attempts to open a non-existent file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service.</p>
<p>A attacker could exploit this vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted web site and convince a user to browse to the page, containing the reference to the non-existing file, and cause the victim's system to stop responding. An attacker could not force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Explorer handles open attempts for non-existent files.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <br>
        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Search handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker could send specially crafted messages to the Windows Search service. An attacker with access to a target computer could exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges and take control of the computer. Additionally, in an enterprise scenario, a remote unauthenticated attacker could remotely trigger the vulnerability through an SMB connection and then take control of a target computer.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Search handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft browsers improperly handle redirect requests. The vulnerability allows Microsoft browsers to bypass CORS redirect restrictions, and to follow redirect requests that should otherwise be ignored. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could force the browser to send data that would otherwise be restricted to a destination website of the attacker's choice.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how affected Microsoft browsers handle redirect requests.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or instant message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Microsoft Windows Text Services Framework handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An open redirect vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange that could lead to spoofing.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a link that has a specially crafted URL, and convince the user to click the link. When an authenticated Exchange user clicks the link, the authenticated user's browser session could be redirected to a malicious site that is designed to impersonate a legitimate website. By doing so, the attacker could trick the user and potentially acquire sensitive information, such as the user's credentials.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Exchange handles open redirect requests.</p>

Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Windows Performance Monitor Console when it improperly parses XML input containing a reference to an external entity. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read arbitrary files via an XML external entity (XXE) declaration.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could create specially crafted XML data and convince an authenticated user to create a Data Collector Set and import the file. To create a Data Collector Set, the user must be a member of the Performance Log Users or Local Administrators group.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows Performance Monitor Console parses XML input.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr>

Exploit code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via an autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus). Network-connected systems are likely to encounter scanning or exploitation attempts.

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Explorer improperly handles executable files and shares during rename operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of another user. Users not running as administrators would be less affected.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first share both a folder and malware named with an executable extension, and then trick the user into thinking that the malware was the folder. The attacker could not force the user to open or browse the share but could use email or instant messages to trick them into doing so.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Explorer handles executable files and shares during rename operations.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

Exploit code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via an autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).

Exploit development has reached the level of reliable, widely-available, easy-to-use automated tools."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Exploit code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via an autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus). Network-connected systems are likely to encounter scanning or exploitation attempts. Exploit development has reached the level of reliable, widely-available, easy-to-use automated tools."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

                            <tr><td title="This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.</p>
<p>Note that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft Exchange Outlook Web Access (OWA) fails to properly handle web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform script/content injection attacks and attempt to trick the user into disclosing sensitive information.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email message containing a malicious link to a user. Alternatively, an attacker could use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Exchange validates web requests.</p>
<p>Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user must click a maliciously crafted link from an attacker.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows improperly handles calls to Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC).</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the local system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control over an affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles calls to ALPC.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when a man-in-the-middle attacker is able to successfully forward an authentication request to a Windows LDAP server, such as a system running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), which has been configured to require signing or sealing on incoming connections.</p>
<p>The update addresses this vulnerability by incorporating support for Extended Protection for Authentication security feature, which allows the LDAP server to detect and block such forwarded authentication requests once enabled.</p>

        <br>
        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>In addition to installing the updates for CVE-2017-8563 are there any further steps I need to carry out to be protected from this CVE?</strong>
Yes. To make LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS more secure, administrators need to create a LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry setting on machine running AD DS or AD LDS. For more information about setting this registry key, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034879">Microsoft Knowledge Base article 4034879</a>.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)"><b>Local</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

                            <tr><td title="This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows Input Method Editor (IME) when IME improperly handles parameters in a method of a DCOM class.</p>
<p>The DCOM server is a Windows component installed regardless of which languages/IMEs are enabled. An attacker can instantiate the DCOM class and exploit the system even if IME is not enabled.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, a locally authenticated attacker could run a specially crafted application.</p>
<p>The security update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Windows IME handles parameters in a method of a DCOM class.</p>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component.

Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email).

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft browser JavaScript engines render content when handling objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the related rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browser JavaScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued.

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft browsers do not properly parse HTTP content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could trick a user by redirecting the user to a specially crafted website. The specially crafted website could either spoof content or serve as a pivot to chain an attack with other vulnerabilities in web services.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, the user must click a specially crafted URL. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could send an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user in an attempt to convince the user to click it.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to appear as a legitimate website to the user. However, the attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the specially crafted website. The attacker would have to convince the user to visit the specially crafted website, typically by way of enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince the user to interact with content on the website.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft browsers parse HTTP responses.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft browser JavaScript engines render content when handling objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the related rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browser JavaScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft browser JavaScript engines render content when handling objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the related rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browser JavaScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.</p>

The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component."><b>Attack Vector</b></td><td title="The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable)."><b>High</b></td></tr>

The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker."><b>Proof-of-Concept</b></td></tr><tr><td title="The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers."><b>Report Confidence</b></td><td title="Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability."><b>Confirmed</b></td></tr>

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft browser JavaScript engines render content when handling objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the related rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browser JavaScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack)."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.</p>

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email).

        <b>Executive Summary:</b> <br><p>A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly handles specific HTML content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could trick a user into believing that the user was on a legitimate website. The specially crafted website could either spoof content or serve as a pivot to chain an attack with other vulnerabilities in web services.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, the user must either browse to a malicious website or be redirected to it. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could send an email message in an attempt to convince the user to click a link to a malicious site.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to appear as a legitimate website to the user. However, the attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the specially crafted website. The attacker would have to convince the user to visit the specially crafted website, typically by way of enticement in an email or instant message.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Edge handles specific HTML content.</p>

        <b>FAQ:</b><br><p><strong>How could an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities?</strong>
In a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer for the desktop, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit any of these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>
<p>In a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer in the Windows 8-style UI, an attacker would first need to compromise a website already listed in the Compatibility View (CV) list. An attacker could then host a website that contains specially crafted Flash content designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email. For more information about Internet Explorer and the CV List, please see the MSDN Article, Developer Guidance for websites with content for Adobe Flash Player in Windows 8.</p>

        <br>
        <b>Workarounds:</b><br><p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running</strong>
You can disable attempts to instantiate Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer and other applications that honor the kill bit feature, such as Office 2007 and Office 2010, by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To set the kill bit for the control in the registry, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Paste the following into a text file and save it with the .reg file extension.</p>
<pre><code> Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
 &quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400

 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
 &quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.</p>
<p>You can also apply this workaround across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, Group Policy collection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
<strong>Impact of workaround</strong>. There is no impact as long as the object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.
<strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong> Delete the registry keys that were added in implementing this workaround.
<strong>Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Internet Explorer through Group Policy</strong>
<strong>Note</strong> The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit, or for an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831791">Group Policy Overview</a>
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc737816%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">What is Group Policy Object Editor?</a>
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc784165%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">Core Group Policy tools and settings</a></p>
<p>To disable Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer through Group Policy, perform the following steps:
<strong>Note</strong> This workaround does not prevent Flash from being invoked from other applications, such as Microsoft Office 2007 or Microsoft Office 2010.</p>
<ol>

<strong>Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Office 2010 on affected systems</strong>
<strong>Note</strong> This workaround does not prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Internet Explorer.
<strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow the steps in the article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>To disable Adobe Flash Player in Office 2010 only, set the kill bit for the ActiveX control for Adobe Flash Player in the registry using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a text file named Disable_Flash.reg with the following contents:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>		[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM\Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
	&quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong> You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
You can also apply this workaround across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=215719">Group Policy collection</a>.
<strong>Prevent ActiveX controls from running in Office 2007 and Office 2010</strong></li>

<ol>
<li>Click File, click Options, click Trust Center, and then click Trust Center Settings.</li>
<li>Click ActiveX Settings in the left-hand pane, and then select Disable all controls without notifications.</li>
<li>Click OK to save your settings.
<strong>Impact of workaround</strong>. Office documents that use embedded ActiveX controls may not display as intended.
<strong>How to undo the workaround</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To re-enable ActiveX controls in Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click File, click Options, click Trust Center, and then click Trust Center Settings.</li>
<li>Click ActiveX Settings in the left-hand pane, and then deselect Disable all controls without notifications.</li>
<li>Click OK to save your settings.
<strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to &quot;High&quot; to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong>
You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.</li>
</ol>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click** Internet Option**s.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Internet</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
<strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
<strong>Impact of workaround</strong>. There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites on the Internet or an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone&quot;.
<strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to return to Internet Explorer, and then click <strong>OK</strong> again.
<strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
<strong>Impact of workaround</strong>. There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone&quot;.
<strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone</strong>
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this website to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
<strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two sites in particular that you may want to add are *<strong>.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</strong> and *<strong>.update.microsoft.com</strong>. These are the sites that will host the update, and they require an ActiveX control to install the update.</li>
