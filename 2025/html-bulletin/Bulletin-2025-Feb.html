Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker�s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority."><b>Unchanged</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers)."><b>Network</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker�s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration."><b>Attack Complexity</b></td><td title="Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability."><b>Privileges Required</b></td><td title="The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources."><b>Low</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner."><b>User Interaction</b></td><td title="Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited."><b>Required</b></td></tr><tr><td title="Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component."><b>Scope</b></td><td title="An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities."><b>Changed</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones."><b>Confidentiality</b></td><td title="There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information."><b>Integrity</b></td><td title="There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component."><b>High</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component."><b>Availability</b></td><td title="There is no impact to availability within the impacted component."><b>None</b></td></tr>

The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final."><b>Remediation Level</b></td><td title="A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available."><b>Official Fix</b></td></tr><tr><td title="This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty.

<br><p><strong>According to the CVSS metrics, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to some loss of confidentiality (C:L) but have no effect on integrity (I:N) or on availability (A:N). What does that mean for this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could view some sensitive information (Confidentiality) but not all resources within the impacted component may be divulged to the attacker. The attacker cannot make changes to disclosed information (Integrity) or limit access to the resource (Availability).</p>
